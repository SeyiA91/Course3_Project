In order to run the script, download it and specify the directory path which indicates
where the *UCI HAR Dataset* directory is in the variable name `dir.path`. Once you have 
completed this step, save the script and source it within the R console to run it.

### Example:
`source(<file path of script>)`

The output provided will result in the appearance of a data frame in the global environment of R,
as well as a saved `.txt` file representative of a cleaned data set called: _tidyDf.txt_.
